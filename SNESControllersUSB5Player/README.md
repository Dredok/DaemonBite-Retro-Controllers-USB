# 5x DaemonBite SNES/NES USB Controller adapter  
# (modified version that supports 5 SNES controllers)

## Introduction
Based on the excellent work in the original project, this version will support 5 SNES gamepads at the same time.

Work around for this issue:

"The CDC Serial uses 3 endpoints. This means you can add up to 3 devices for the 32u4 and 1 for the 8/16/32u2. If you add more, some will be ignored."

I found a fix, that others have used when creating usb keyboards. It disables the CDC to free up resources. https://github.com/gdsports/usb-metamorph/tree/master/USBSerPassThruLine
